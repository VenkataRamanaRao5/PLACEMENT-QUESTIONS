## Online Assessment Overview  

- 18 Questions ==> 1.5hrs
- 3 DSA and 15MCQ
- 15 MCQs were from OS,LINUX,UNIX,C,Networks,C++
- DSA questions were superb easy only hard part is the LANGUAGE BARRIER...they aksed us to code only in `C` or `C++`

> **NOTE** If u don't know   `C` or `C++` ,then you are cooked.

## Question 1: *Postfix to infix*  
**Description:**  
- In this problem you will provided with the Postfix expression in the form of a string Your job is to convert this Postfix expression to Infix expression
- *In-fix expression* : The expression of the form A op B.In this representation the operator is present between 2 operands eg. A op BA and B both are operands and op represent operator)
- *Post-fix expression* : The expression of the form A B op in this representation an operator is followed after the operands eg. AB oplA and B both are operands and op represent operator)

**Examples & Constraints:**  
- Example 1:
  - `s` = "abc*+"
  - Ans is (a+(b*c))
- Example 2:
  - `S` = "ghif+*-"
  - Ans is (g-(h*(i+g)))
- Constraints:
  - weren't given
  - Execution time limit was `1 second`  

**Tags:**  `stack`

## Question 2: *Biary swaps*  
**Description:**  
- You need to write a program that takes binary number as input and then you need to swap 1's and O's of that input, Now print the newly formed number in its decimal representation and also check whether it is a prime number or not.

**Examples & Constraints:**  
- Example 1:
  - `S` = "1001"
  - Ans is `"6 False"` 
- Constraints:
  - only binary representation of digits will be given as input
  - $1 \leq |S| \leq 10^2$

**Tags:**  `prime`, `bit manupulation`

## Question 3: *Dreamplay and the order*  
**Description:**  
- Dreamplay takes $3$ Strings `A` , `B` and `C`. String `B` and `C` are currently empty, whereas String `A` consists of lowercase alphabets with length `N`.
- You are allowed to perform two kinds of operations.
  - ***Operation 1***: Take out the starting character of String A and add it to the end of String B.
  - ***Operation 2***: Take out the ending character of String B and add it to the end of String C.
- Can you tell Dreamplay, the lexicographically smallest string of length Nithat can be obtained as string C, using only the above 2 operations, any number of times.
- Lexicographical smallest string means the smallest string in which all letters of the string are alphabetically sorted.
- `agr` is a word following the lexicographical order because all the letters are alphabercary sorted.
- `rag` ins't lexicographically ordered
- Input contains only string `A`

**Examples & Constraints:**  
- Example 1:
  -  A = `"rag"`
  -  Ans is `agr`
- Example 2: ...  
- Constraints:
  - $I \leq |A| \leq 10^5$    where |A| denotes length of String A.

**Tags:**  `stack` , `greedy`
