## Question 1: *Power of 2*  
**Description:**  
- Given `n` the number of inputs and for the next n lines you would get an string of binary number.
- You have to print true or false if the number is a power of 2 or not.

  

**Examples & Constraints:**  
- Example 1: 
  ```
  4
  00001
  01001
  00100
  11000
  ```
  ```
  True
  False
  True
  False
  ```  
- Constraints:
  - $1 \leq n \leq 100$
  - $1 \leq s \leq 8$

**Tags:**  `bit manupulation` , `string`

## Question 2: *Lexicographically smallest beautiful string*  
**Description:**  
- A non-empty binary string is said to be ***Good susbtring*** used,
  - number of zeros is equal to number of ones. *ie) no(0) = no(1)
  - For every prefix number of 1 is not less than number of zeros. ie) *for every prefix no(1)>=no(0)
- A good substring can contain multiple good substring.
- If 2 consecutive substrings are good,they can be swapped as long as the result is still a good susbtring.
- Given a binary string,perforem one or more swaps in the adjacent good substrings such that resultant string is largest possib;e numerical value.
> Two strings are adjacent if last characters if 1st substring occurs exactly 1 index after the 1st character of 2nd susbtring.

**Examples & Constraints:**  
- Example 1: `s= 1010111000`
  - `1010` and `111000` are 2 good susbtrings.
  - After the swap `1110001010`.
- Example 2:
  - `s=11011000`
  - `10` and `1100` are 2 good susbtring.
  - After the swap `1110010`

- Constraints: ...

### Thought Process  

 - 1st question can be done by counting.If the number of $1s$ is greater than `1`,then we can say it's not a power of 2.or we can find the number from string s and calculate via `n&(n-1)`.

### Solution  
- none
